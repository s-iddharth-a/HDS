            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How much will my cabinets cost?</h3>
                <p>Cabinets vary dramatically in price just like cars or houses. Entry-level cabinets are less expensive than cabinets with special finishes and upgraded storage features. HDS provides cabinetry that fits most any budget—from basic to bold.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How long will it take to get the cabinets I order?</h3>
                <p>Order time varies depending on the manufacturer and the complexity of the job. The minimum time is roughly three weeks and can be as much as eight weeks during peak times of the year.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can you design my kitchen from a sketch of the room that I provide?</h3>
                <p>We can certainly start with a sketch you provide. Your forethought in doing some homework can shorten the time needed to design the final layout. However, we will always do our own measurements to verify that the design will actually work.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is the best type of countertop for the kitchen?</h3>
                <p>There are many possible countertop choices. As with cabinets, your budget needs to be matched with your desire for flexibility of design and product longevity. Laminate, solid surface, quartz-enhanced, and granite are all good choices.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can you match my existing cabinets or furniture?</h3>
                <p>All woods and stains change color over time—some more so than others. In many cases, HDS can find cabinetry that may be compatible with your existing cabinets or furniture. In no case can we guarantee an exact match.</p>

Check for KCMA certification for quality assurance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
