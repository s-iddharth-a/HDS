    <div class="about-container">
        <h2>About Home Design Solutions</h2>
        
        <p>HDS started as a remodeling effort by Emily and her husband Joe back in May 2007. They had contracted to do work for some family and friends that wanted to upgrade their existing homes (bathrooms and kitchens are their specialty). This included providing design work, and upgrades to kitchens and baths. Emily and Joe quickly determined that there was a tremendous need for this service in the greater Phoenix/Scottsdale, AZ area.</p>
        
        <p>They applied for a business license and opened Home Design Solutions as an LLC out of a small store location they rented at <span class="highlight">101 Sedalia Drive, Phoenix, AZ 85001</span>. The first store location included some sample cabinets and appliances that they would later become regional distributors for. Both Joe and Emily became General Contractors in 2007 and all their bath and kitchen design specialists that have been hired since have acquired kitchen and bath design certifications.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h3 class="section-title">Early Growth</h3>
            <p>They saw rapid growth for their company and hired <span class="highlight">2 sales associates</span> to help with the increased demand and <span class="highlight">3 cabinet, appliance and bathroom installers</span> and offer delivery services if needed. They added <span class="highlight">2 more employees</span>, one to keep track of appointments and one to schedule the work of the installers and renovators. The other employee helped with deliveries and warehousing (they have a very limited warehouse and cannot stock items for more than 2-3 weeks).</p>

            <p>They became so busy with their construction, design and consultation services and trying to run a successful small business that they hired a design/sales professional to take over much of their design work.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Expansion</h3>
            <p>In <span class="highlight">2009</span>, they opened a second location at <span class="highlight">901 S. Sedona Way, Scottsdale, AZ</span>. This was a much smaller location and included only <span class="highlight">4 employees</span> (2 sales and design associates and 2 installation/renovation and delivery associates). Since that time the Scottsdale location has added <span class="highlight">2 more installation/renovation and delivery associates, 1 office manager, and 1 store manager</span> that could also do sales and design work.</p>

            <p>In <span class="highlight">2012</span>, they opened their third location in Tucson, AZ, at <span class="highlight">8023 Sedalia Dr., Phoenix, AZ</span>. They followed the same pattern as the Scottsdale location but hired all the employees at one time (<span class="highlight">7 employees total</span>, similar to the Scottsdale location).</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">National Expansion</h3>
            <p>Their latest endeavor, in <span class="highlight">June 2016</span>, was the purchase of <span class="highlight">2 existing stores</span> out of state:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Elite Home Renovations</span> in Las Vegas, NV – a high-end appliance and bathroom specialist.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">IRB Home Supply</span> in Albuquerque, NM – a typical home supply store.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Elite has a more sophisticated system, with a server running Windows Server 2016, and 4 workstations connected through an 8-port Linksys Switch running Windows 10.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Representing Manufacturers</h3>
            <p>HDS represents a wide range of manufacturers that offer cutting-edge products. You can browse current models and technical specifications on their website. They aim to give customers direct access to the products that interest them most.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Financial Success</h3>
            <p>HDS has proven to be a financial success, with total gross revenue exceeding <span class="highlight">$14.5 million</span>. They operate at a gross margin of <span class="highlight">30%</span> and spend about <span class="highlight">$1.775 million</span> annually on salaries and benefits for their 39 employees (including Joe and Emily). Overhead costs amount to about <span class="highlight">$75,000 per month</span> for all 5 locations, which covers maintenance and upkeep of company vehicles.</p>

            <p>They own <span class="highlight">10 delivery trucks</span>, with 2 located at each location. If one store requires a delivery, it can use vehicles and staff from other locations as available.</p>

            <p>Their dedication to quality, customer service, and expansion has helped make Home Design Solutions one of the leading remodeling services in the region.</p>
